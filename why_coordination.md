# Why coordination-stack

In the traditional world, humans rely on legal documents to trust each other to create non-zero-sum games.

## **Why do we need legal documents, and what are their limitations?**

* We rely on employment agreements to ensure employers and employees can trust each other to follow certain rules and work towards a common goal.
* Founders and Investors rely on SHAs(shareholding agreements) to trust each other, follow ethical practices, and produce great outcomes.

While these legal documents enable trust between two entities to coordinate, they are extremely costly in time and money. This cost makes traditional legal documents inflexible and fails to align incentives between individual entities to the edges.

#### **Here are a few examples of how unconsciously traditional legal documents limit coordination.**

### **Startup Cofounders**

Most Startup people might argue that having more than four cofounders is not ideal. Having ten cofounders in an early-stage project is almost impossible to imagine. But why can't a startup have ten people as cofounders contributing with different capacities and aligning incentives and decision-making power accordingly?

Is it because decision-making becomes complicated and slows if there are ten co-founders? What if those ten people have varying voting power based on their contributions? Then, the #1 contributing founder can have ten voting powers vs. the #10th contributing founder. The point is if we could enable governance power and financial incentives to be modular, we can design different incentive alignments based on someone's efforts and impact.

These conditions are much easier to put into code as part of a smart contract on a permissionless blockchain than creating different legal contracts to accommodate those ten founders to help the same cause, even when each single could add a non-zero-sum value to the organization.

### **Employees incentive misalignment**

In almost every organization, the output per employee decreases as the number of people increases. We see two main reasons for this.

1. Incentives are so skewed toward early contributors that there are almost no incentives for those who come after founders, 50 employees, or 500 employees.
2. All traditional organizations try to rent an equal amount of time from each of their employees.

Instead, what if

1. Anyone can come and see what an organization needs right now.
2. Anyone can see the financial or non-financial incentives for helping the organization with those needs.

In that scenario, anyone can contribute to a problem statement for that organization and move on.

### **Funding problem**

Whenever an organization is trying to raise funds, it faces multiple problems...

* All investors want to invest but want to wait till someone else invests.
* Some investors want to invest only once the startup has a lead investor.
* Investors want promotors to sign terms to ensure they don't misspend their money.
* Investors don't want promoters to sell their equity without getting their principal invested amount back.

All these problems could be resolved using smart contracts, which allow you to create transparent incentives for investors to come first or write limits on fund withdrawals based on certain conditions, such as withdrawal amount, time, purpose, or milestones.
