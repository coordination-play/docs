# What is coordination-stack?

Coordination-stack is a toolkit focusing on finance, identity, and governance to promote efficiency and scalability for internet-native organisations.

## Why coordination-stack?

Humans need to trust each other to coordinate and create non-zero sum output.&#x20;

In traditional organisations, trust is established among different entities using different tools and processes.

* We rely on employment agreements to enable trust between companies and employees.&#x20;
* In traditional companies, everyone works in the same physical office, so productivity is easy to measure(at least a perception of that).
* Companies hire new people after spending much time and money on background checks and interviews.

But this is inefficient, especially in the time when we are moving to remote work. Now, people want to work from different places, with the people they like to work with on the problems they feel passionate about. More and more entrepreneurs are starting businesses with remote work cultures to attract talent. At the same time, many businesses are focusing on community-led growth. We call them internet-native organisations. In these types of organisations, 1000s or even millions of people play their part in making the organisation successful. Web3 communities are an example of that. We believe all organisations will operate like that in future.&#x20;

These internet-native organisations need the right financial, identity, and governance tools to build trust and enable coordination. The coordination-stack is trying to solve that problem.

## Solution

We are building multiple onchain stacks as part of the coordination-stack to enable internet-native organisations work at scale.

## Attribution stack

The 1st stack we are working on is called attribution stack. Attribution stack is the base layer of coordination stack.&#x20;

The goal of attribution stack is to put contribution data onchain. Organisations upload points of all the contirbutors every month for a specific guild/tag. A guild can be dev/design/product management/marketing. And an organisation can create sub organisation to even further sub categorise guilds like Starknet Dev as organisation and backend/frontend as guilds. Points are computed offchain as different organisations and guild will have different frameworks to compute points. Attibution data remains immutable.

## Financial stack

Financial stack helps organisation distribute incentives in a permissionless and transparant way using the attribution stack. For example an organisation can distribute 100k to dev guild and all the contributors in the dev guild can claim their precomputed rewards themselves based on their points earned for a particular period.

## Identity stack

Identity stack helps contributors build their identity and as a result help them get access to more opportunities and influence over time. For example an organisation might decide to airdrop all the people who contributed to Starknet in a quantifiable way instead on relying on who made a typo commit in Starknet github. Or a founder can show a VC that she was the 1st engineer at Starknet and contributed meaningfully.&#x20;

## Governance stack

Governance stack helps created a modular governance framework to let organisations adopt different governance modules for different guild. For example an organisation might want to give higher power to design points for any design level decision or higher points to marketing guild points.&#x20;
