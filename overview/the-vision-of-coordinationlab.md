# The vision of CoordinationLab

## We want to bring transparency and composability to human coordination.&#x20;



Most humans don't think of finance all day like we crypto degens do. Most humans create productive outcomes for the world, get paid in a bank account, and use that money to passively invest and sometimes speculate. That's how we believe humans will adopt crypto, not the speculative financial way we see today with hundreds of chains and meaningless tokens.&#x20;

Bringing human input and output onchain will bring the whole human labour economy onchain.&#x20;

## Possible impact of coordination-stack:

Blockchain's most powerful value addition to society is composability and transparency. We are bringing composability and transparency to human coordination.&#x20;

### We believe the coordination-stack will help billions of humans coordinate harmoniously.

## Few examples

### Consumer Banks

When someone earns their salary in a bank account, they don't think about switching the bank account now and then. Banks have the highest retention rates as financial products. In the same way, when someone gets their financial rewards for their work in an onchain wallet, that becomes their default bank account. Most users will like to keep most of their finances in the most stable asset and invest some percentages from a long-term perspective.&#x20;

### Credit Finance

We have often heard people talking about when blockchains will enable uncollateralized loans.   With all the contribution data coming onchain and the financial rewards coming onchain, it will be very easy for lenders to issue credits to people. Since they can see how much a person has been earning for the last 6 months, how consistently they are working and earning and who is paying them. Using such rich, transparent data, we will be able to create a credit system that's 10 times more credible and efficient than traditional credit scores.  Onchain credit finance will be much bigger than traditional credit finance with this kind of efficiencies.
