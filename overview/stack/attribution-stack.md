# Attribution stack

The attribution stack is the centrepiece of the coordination stack. Nothing works without it. The goal of the attribution stack is to store the relative value of contributions for all contributors onchain in an organisation across different guilds/teams/skills.

## **How does attribution stack work?**

An organisation distributes points to its contributors for completing any work every month. These points are uploaded onchain and become immutable.

Then, that organisation can use these immutable points to distribute governance power using[governance-stack.md](governance-stack.md "mention") and reward the contributor using the [financial-stack.md](financial-stack.md "mention")

## What are guilds?

When an organisation assigns points to a contributor, it chooses a category for which it is assigning them. These categories are called guilds.

Some examples of guilds

* guilds similar to teams in an organisation like a dev team, design team, etc
* guilds for a dev team like a java team, solidity team

Guilds can be in the form of sub-guilds as well by creating an organisation for the top guild.

By having points onchain, anyone can see and verify the contribution history of a contributor to a particular org in a specific guild.



This enables an organisation to pre-define work so anyone from anywhere can pick it up and complete it. The organization can give points for completing the work based on effort and impact. As someone does more work, they earn contribution points.&#x20;
