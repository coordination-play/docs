## How do we design coordination-stack?

We categorised four building blocks to solve some of the mentioned problems.

1. Fundraise stack - helps you raise funds
2. Governance stack - helps you define decision making powers
3. Contribution attribution stack - helps you create financial incentives and governance between contributors
4. Financial stack - helps you distribute rewards(ownership tokens, stables), create financial auditability

### Attribution stack

Attribution is the centre piece. Nothing works without it in coordination stack. So we should optimise for helping attribution for different problem statements. 

**Overview: what and why**

We atomize the work of an organization in such a way that anyone from anywhere can pick and complete the work. The organization gives some points to complete the work based on effort and impact. It enables anyone to pick the work and complete the work. As someone does more and more work, they earn contribution points. This will give every human the freedom to

- Work from anywhere
- Work for things they like
- Work for the incentives that work for them
- Work with the people they like

And this freedom will boost the creativity and productivity of individuals and collectives.

### Fundraise stack

We can work on this later. Or we can only think from grants perspective to start with.

**Overview: what and why**

Funding round contract

- inputs
    - expiry
    - amount you want to raise
    - #tokens you are willing to give for that amount
    - curve
    - investor rights
        - inflation protection
        -
